                    Queried multiple databases in MySQL to search for information helpful to our clients; I provided SSRS reports tailored to clients' needs using this information.   
                    In order to appropriately meet the requirements of this position, I consistently prioritized my obligation to clearly understand the specific needs of each client.   
                    Responsibilities of position also provided the opportunity to study the use of, and apply my knowledge of, terms specific to the financial/debt industry.  
                    I enjoyed this remote work experience while practicing communication skills necessary to successfully work with others in such environments.

                    Primarily filled the requirements of Banquet Chef position; organized timing, people and products in a fast-paced environment to feed hundreds of clients for each meal.  
                    I ordered food, scheduled time of employees, and expedited on the A la Carte lunch and dinner lines.  
                    During weeks our team had no Executive Chef, I filled requirements of that position's responsibilities until replacements could join us.   
                    During busy seasons, I often worked several shifts, upwards of 12 hours, for most days of the season.
